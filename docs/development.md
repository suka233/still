# Developing Still

## Layout

```
packages/core     Platform-independent domain logic (no DOM, no Intl, no crypto):
                  calendar dates, billing cycles, money, HLC timestamps,
                  reminders, file-per-record repository. Runs in goja.
packages/engine   The service every host runs: owns reads/writes, schedules
                  reminders, claims them across devices, pushes, writes daily
                  notes. Hosts plug in storage, HTTP, timers and events.
packages/ui       React + shadcn/ui views shared by every host. Tailwind classes
                  are prefixed `still:`; no global preflight. Eight themes render
                  one superset markup (`stl-*`) styled per theme with @scope.
apps/siyuan       SiYuan plugin: kernel.js (goja; runs the engine behind RPC) and
                  index.js (frontend: dock, tab, status bar, reminder card).
apps/obsidian     Obsidian plugin: main.js runs the engine in-process over a vault
                  folder (default `Still/`); sidebar, manager tab, settings tab.
                  Its CSS is lifted one id of specificity above Obsidian's
                  element styles at build time.
tools/goja-runner Runs JS in the same goja setup SiYuan uses, for tests.
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # core unit tests + kernel.js end-to-end in real goja (needs Go)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build       # apps/siyuan/dist + package.zip, apps/obsidian/dist
```

Develop against a dedicated SiYuan workspace (needs SiYuan 3.8.5+ installed; the
script uses its kernel binary, trusts bazaar plugins and turns update downloads off):

```bash
pnpm --filter @still/siyuan dev                     # rebuild on change
node apps/siyuan/scripts/serve.mjs                  # kernel on :6899, workspace ~/SiYuan/still-dev
node apps/siyuan/scripts/seed.mjs --reset           # demo data
node tools/snap/snap.mjs /tmp/snaps                 # Playwright screenshots for visual QA
```

Or link `dist/` into an existing workspace with `node apps/siyuan/scripts/link.mjs <workspace>`.

### Obsidian

```bash
pnpm --filter @still/obsidian dev                   # rebuild apps/obsidian/dist on change
node apps/obsidian/scripts/link.mjs <vault>         # symlink dist into <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/still
```

For automated checks, run an isolated Obsidian (its own profile and vault list,
leaving yours untouched) with the DevTools protocol on:

```bash
/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/Obsidian --user-data-dir=/tmp/still-obsidian --remote-debugging-port=9333
node apps/obsidian/scripts/seed.mjs --reset --lang en   # demo data through the plugin's engine
```

`app.plugins.plugins.still.engine` exposes the same API the views use.

Tutorial clips live in `docs/tutorial/clips/` and are recorded with the
make-kmind-tutorial-slice-lite pipeline against the dev kernel.

## Design notes

- **The kernel plugin is the single writer.** The frontend calls it over
  JSON-RPC (`apps/siyuan/src/shared/rpc.ts`); it broadcasts `changed` and
  `reminders-due`. Reminders are computed even when no window is open.
- **One file per subscription** under `data/storage/petal/still/subscriptions/`,
  so SiYuan's file-level sync behaves like per-record last-writer-wins.
  Deletes are tombstones. `updatedAt` is a hybrid logical clock string, ready
  for a sync server.
- **Dates are civil dates** (`YYYY-MM-DD`), never instants. Month cycles are
  computed from the anchor (Jan 31 → Feb 28 → Mar 31). The kernel uses the
  host time zone; Docker deployments should set `TZ`.
- **Reminders** collapse missed thresholds into the most urgent one, wait for
  `notifyAt` on the day, and are claimed atomically so only one window shows
  each one. Delivery logs are per device (`delivered/<deviceId>.json`).
- **Obsidian has no background process**, so the engine runs inside the
  plugin: reminders, push and daily-note entries happen while Obsidian is open
  on some device, and missed ones are caught up on the next start or focus.
  Records live in a vault folder (default `Still/`, same layout as SiYuan) so
  any vault sync carries them; per-device delivery logs keep every reminder to
  one device.

## Releasing

Both plugins ship from one GitHub release whose tag is the bare version
(`0.1.0`): Obsidian looks releases up by exact tag and reads `manifest.json` /
`versions.json` from the repository root; the SiYuan bazaar installs
`package.zip` from the latest release. Bump `apps/siyuan/plugin.json`,
`manifest.json` and `versions.json` together — `node tools/check-release.mjs
[tag]` checks them, and the release workflow runs it on the tag.
